# Make sure you have latest ghc installed and working along with
# cabal_install. This might not be needed eventually but currently it requires
# installing ghc6 for bootstrapping purposes:

# sudo aptitude -y ghc6 libgmp3-dev libgmpxx4ldbl libncurses5-dev libreadline5-dev libxft2-dev zlib1g-dev

# Once that is done you can install cabal_install using it's bootstrap script

# Then finally:
cabal update
cabal upgrade
cabal install xmonad
cabal --flags="use_xft with_utf8" --ghc-options="-XPostfixOperators" install xmonad-contrib
